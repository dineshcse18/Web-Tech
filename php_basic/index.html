<pre>
<h3>
<ul>
<li>PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor
<li>PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.
<li>PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.

//This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment

/* This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple lines
*/

<li>In PHP, all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.

echo "My first PHP script!";        O/P:My first PHP script!
ECHO "Hello World!";				O/P:Hello World!

<li>print also can be used:
print "PHP is Fun!";				O/P:PHP is Fun!


<li>In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:

$txt = "Hello world!";
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;


=>variable names are case-sensitive.
$color = "red";
echo "My car is " . $color . "";			O/P:My car is red
echo "My house is " . $COLOR . "";			O/P:My house is 


<li>arithmetic operations can be done:
	$x = 5;
	$y = 4;
	echo $x + $y;							O/P:9

Global and Local Scope:
<li>A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function
<li>A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function.

$x = 5; //global scope
function myTest() {
//using x inside this function will generate an error
echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();
echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";

O/P:
Variable x inside function is:

Variable x outside function is: 5

<li>Global variables can be used within the function using the keyword global

$x = 5;
$y = 10;

function myTest() {
    global $x, $y;
    $y = $x + $y;
}

myTest();
echo $y;

O/P:15

<li>Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.
To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:

function myTest() {
    static $x = 0;
    echo $x;
    $x++;
}
myTest();

myTest();

myTest();

O/P:

0

PHP Data Types

Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.

PHP supports the following data types:

    =>String
    =>Integer
    =>Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
    =>Boolean
    =>Array
    =>Object
    =>NULL
    =>Resource


<li>The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:


$x = 5985;
var_dump($x);								O/P:int(5985) 

$cars = array("Volvo","BMW","Toyota");
var_dump($cars);							O/P:array(3) { [0]=> string(5) "Volvo" [1]=> string(3) "BMW" [2]=> string(6) "Toyota" }

=>Length of string:
echo strlen("Hello world!");				O/P: 12

=>word count:
echo str_word_count("Hello world!");	 	O/P: 2

=>string reverse:
echo strrev("Hello world!");				O/P:!dlrow olleH

=>The PHP strpos() function searches for a specific text within a string.

=>If a match is found, the function returns the character position of the first match. If no match is found, it will return FALSE.
echo strpos("Hello world!", "world");		O/P:6

=>Replace Text Within a String
echo str_replace("world", "Dolly", "Hello world!");		O/P:Hello Dolly!

=>Create a PHP Constant
define("GREETING", "Baby ");
echo GREETING;								O/P:Baby

Constants are Global
<li>Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.

define("GREETING", "Baby");

function myTest() {
    echo GREETING;
}
 
myTest();									O/P:Baby

PHP Operators

<li>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

<li>PHP divides the operators in the following groups:

   <li> Arithmetic operators
   <li> Assignment operators
    <li>Comparison operators
    <li>Increment/Decrement operators
    <li>Logical operators
    <li>String operators
    <li>Array operators

=>PHP Arithmetic Operators

Operator 	 Name 	    	Example 	   Result 	
+ 	       	Addition 	$x + $y 	Sum of $x and $y 	
- 	    	Subtraction 	$x - $y 	Difference of $x and $y 	
* 	   	Multiplication 	$x * $y 	Product of $x and $y 	
/ 	        Division 	$x / $y 	Quotient of $x and $y 	
% 	        Modulus		$x % $y 	Remainder of $x divided by $y 	
** 	        Exponentiation  $x ** $y 	Result of raising $x to the $y'th power (Introduced in PHP 5.6)

=>PHP Assignment Operators

Assignment 	    	Same as... 	    Description 	
x = y 	        	x = y 	   	The left operand gets set to the value of the expression on the right 	
x += y 	        	x = x + y 	Addition 	
x -= y 			x = x - y 	Subtraction 	
x *= y 			x = x * y 	Multiplication 	
x /= y 			x = x / y 	Division 	
x %= y 			x = x % y 	Modulus


=>PHP Comparison Operators
<li>The PHP comparison operators are used to compare two values (number or string):

Operator 	Name 				Example 		Result 	
== 		Equal 				$x == $y 		Returns true if $x is equal to $y 	
=== 		Identical			$x === $y 		Returns true if $x is equal to $y, and they are of the same type 	
!= 		Not equal 			$x != $y 		Returns true if $x is not equal to $y 	
&lt &gt 		Not equal 			$x&lt &gt$y 		Returns true if $x is not equal to $y 	
!== 		Not identical 			$x !== $y 		Returns true if $x is not equal to $y, or they are not of the same type 	
&gt 		Greater than 			$x &gt $y 		Returns true if $x is greater than $y 	
&lt 		Less than 			$x &lt $y 		Returns true if $x is less than $y 	
&gt= 		Greater than or equal to 	$x &gt= $y 		Returns true if $x is greater than or equal to $y 	
&gt= 		Less than or equal to 		$x &lt= $y 		Returns true if $x is less than or equal to $y

=>PHP Increment / Decrement Operators
<li>The PHP increment operators are used to increment a variable's value.
<li>The PHP decrement operators are used to decrement a variable's value.

Operator 		Name 		Description 	
++$x 		Pre-increment 	Increments $x by one, then returns $x 	
$x++ 		Post-increment 	Returns $x, then increments $x by one 	
--$x 		Pre-decrement 	Decrements $x by one, then returns $x 	
$x-- 		Post-decrement 	Returns $x, then decrements $x by one

=>PHP Logical Operators:

<li>The PHP logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

Operator 	Name 	Example 	Result 
and 		And 	$x and $y 	True if both $x and $y are true 	
or 		Or	$x or $y 	True if either $x or $y is true 	
xor 		Xor 	$x xor $y 	True if either $x or $y is true, but not both 	
&& 		And 	$x && $y 	True if both $x and $y are true 	
|| 		Or	$x || $y 	True if either $x or $y is true 	
! 		Not 	!$x 		True if $x is not true

=>PHP String Operators

<li>PHP has two operators that are specially designed for strings.
Operator 		Name 					Example 		Result 
. 			Concatenation 				$txt1 . $txt2 		Concatenation of $txt1 and $txt2 	
.= 			Concatenation assignment 		$txt1 .= $txt2 		Appends $txt2 to $txt1

=>PHP Array Operators:

<li>The PHP array operators are used to compare arrays.
Operator 		Name 			Example 	Result 	
+ 			Union 			$x + $y 	Union of $x and $y 	
== 			Equality 		$x == $y 	Returns true if $x and $y have the same key/value pairs 	
=== 			Identity 		$x === $y 	Returns true if $x and $y have the same key/value pairs in the same order and of the same types 	
!= 			Inequality 		$x != $y 	Returns true if $x is not equal to $y 	
<> 			Inequality 		$x <> $y 	Returns true if $x is not equal to $y 	
!== 			Non-identity 		$x !== $y 	Returns true if $x is not identical to $y

=>PHP - The if...else Statement

The if....else statement executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.
Syntax
if (condition) {
    code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
    code to be executed if condition is false;
}
<Li>
The example below will output "Have a good day!" if the current time is less than 20, and "Have a good night!" otherwise:
Example

$t = date("H");

if ($t &lt "20") {
    echo "Have a good day!";
} else {
    echo "Have a good night!";
}


O/P:Have a good night! 

<li>The PHP switch Statement

Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.

$favcolor = "red";

switch ($favcolor) {
    case "red":
        echo "Your favorite color is red!";
        break;
    case "blue":
        echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
        break;
    case "green":
        echo "Your favorite color is green!";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
}

O/P:Your favorite color is red!


do while:

Syntax
do {
    code to be executed;
} while (condition is true);

Example:

$x = 1;

do {
    echo "The number is: $x ";
    $x++;
} while ($x &lt= 5);

O/P:

The number is: 1
The number is: 2
The number is: 3
The number is: 4
The number is: 5 

For loop:
<li>The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.

Syntax
for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {
    code to be executed;
}


for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
    echo "The number is: $x ";
} 


O/P:

The number is: 0
The number is: 1
The number is: 2
The number is: 3
The number is: 4
The number is: 5
The number is: 6
The number is: 7
The number is: 8
The number is: 9
The number is: 10 

Functions

<li>A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.

<li>A function will not execute immediately when a page loads.

<li>A function will be executed by a call to the function.

Syntax
function functionName() {
    code to be executed;
}

Example:

function writeMsg() {
    echo "Hello world!";
}

writeMsg(); // call the function


O/P:

Hello world!

Arrays:
<li>An array stores multiple values in one single variable:

Example:

$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
echo "I like " . $cars[0] . ", " . $cars[1] . " and " . $cars[2] . ".";

O/P:

I like Volvo, BMW and Toyota. 

<li>Get The Length of an Array - The count() Function

$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
echo count($cars);

O/P:

3

<li>Loop Through an Indexed Array

$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
$arrlength = count($cars);
for($x = 0; $x < $arrlength; $x++) {
    echo $cars[$x];
    
}


O/P:

Volvo
BMW
Toyota


$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
echo "Peter is " . $age['Peter'] . " years old.";

O/P:

Peter is 35 years old.
